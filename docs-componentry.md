# componentry
This is a bleeding edge list of the componentry that Dockistry currently supports via our CLI and web based editor as default options.  That doesn't mean that
others cannot be integrated, they would just need to be added as a dependency in any of the bower/npm/jspm files for package management.

### attachment containers
the following are containers that are attached in the docker-compose file if the project contains package management dependencies using any of these:

-  nodejs and npm
-  yeoman generators
-  bower dependencies
-  apt-get
-  github pulls
-  ruby rvm pulls
-  go-lang gvm pulls
-  gitlab local or remote repos
-  bitbucket repos

### datagrids roadmap
the following grids are those we intend to support by default via the CLI as attachments in the build process, in the form of npm dependencies.

- ui grid
- handsontable
- kendo ui pro
- dynatable
- datatables

### state management roadmap
these are state management tools we intend to support
- alt
- flux
- handsontable
- kendo/ dojo

### ui components roadmap
these are ui packages we intend to support by default for our strategy baselines
