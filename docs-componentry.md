# dockistry components
Dockistry incorporates many different components within production and development environments in a customized [build process](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docs-build-process.md).

## package managers 
A list of the package managers we are supporting in our production and development CLIs:
-  npm
-  bower
-  yeoman
 
## other tools
We support package and dependency management from other tools so long as they are installed via the use of an attachment container via the fullstack strategy docker-compose YAML:

-  apt-get
-  github pulls
-  ruby rvm pulls
-  go-lang gvm pulls
-  gitlab local or remote repos
-  bitbucket repos

### datagrids roadmap
We intend to offer the following datagrids as add-ons for fullstack projects.  These are mainly just listed as examples, but I'm intending to incorporate the ability to easily search and add components for CDNjs, NPM, Bower, Yeoman, and others natively in the desktop configuration tool.

- ui grid
- handsontable
- kendo ui pro
- dynatable
- datatables
- links to the above grids can be [found here](http://jspreadsheets.com/)
