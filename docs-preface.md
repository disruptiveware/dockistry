  All too frequently over the course of [my career](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/dockistry-contributors/cho), I've chosen the wrong technology and gotten stuck with it.  This is easy to do.  Given the vast amount of tools and technologies readily available on the web, I've turned into a bit of a magpie developer.  I don't think this is a bad thing, but there certainly needs to be an organized method to address the relative chaos of fullstack development.

 It's not uncommon for fullstack developers to have huge amounts of starred/watched repos on github.  If you've ever been burned on technology decisions when implementing on a grand scale, then you know the key is to avoid dependencies on any one technology where possible, and enourage flexibility in resolving dependency issues network wide via an abundance of practical alternatives. The problem this creates is that there really isn't too much focus on pairing technologies together, which is the problem Dockistry aims to primarily address.  We call such pairing "strategy".
  
   I've chosen to intentionally moderate how far I get involved with various frameworks and other technologies.  After all, there is always something new coming out, and the grass *really is* greener on the other side.  This approach provides a broad viewport, and from there I can see far-reaching interactions & possibilities.   

  The success I've had using the aforementioned technique along with early adoption of newer technologies such as Docker & Rancher, is what has inspired me to bring a fresh perspective to the open source community through Dockistry.   Dockistry intends to be a strategy-based engine to deploy both devtools & production stacks. It will be truly accomodating to multi-platform, multi-language deploys.
  
   The tools provided by Dockistry are curated & lean intentionally so they can be re-used/ easily forked.  I am building the primary desktop software based off an entirely web-based app integrated into a Git, Docker, and NPM registry.  This allows the app to stay current without regular updates to the binaries, and will allow the same API to be accessed through a variety of separate tooling packages as things progress.  The registry is pretty lightweight, since it's all just docker-composition files and basic boilerplates.  So the idea is to clone the whole thing and quickly browse various strategies locally, then deploy them.

I intend to galvanize any skeptic-thinkers by hitting people with a truly fresh take on stack development & deployment, something they haven't seen ever before.  I'm stoked to be able to do that.
