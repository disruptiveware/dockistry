# Dockistry

> - Why clone one git repository after another, just to test solutions, and stack examples only to have them fail, or annoy you?
> - Why bother doing this again and again, only to find out the solution isn't _truly_ end-to-end or fails where it wasn't supposed to
> - Why attempt to setup your own critical infrastructure on Amazon or Google Cloud clusters if you don't have to?

Dockistry is a curated docker registry (bam!  two-words in one!) of expertly crafted fullstack, e2e, continuous integration, and testing solutions... built by some nerd who is most certainly vitamin D deficient (and jurassically obsessed).

## Why so bomb-diggity, you might ask?
***With Dockistry***, you choose from over 30 stem baselines and hundreds of component combinations, cluster options, database options, and more (or let our app suggest them)...  all from our comfy desktop app.  So smooth it makes the beach boys sounds even sweeter, and just like the beach boys... we "get around" having to host your stuff like most services offering this (i.e.- Heroku, Devo.ps, Scalingo, Azure, etc.).  

Once you find what you're after, deploy your bitchin' fullstack solution instantly to a local machine for testing, or to AWS/Google instantly for staging or production environments. All without programming or touching a shell window, configuration prompt, or control panel.  ~ SUPA_TIGHT AMIRITE?!

## True-facts 
- Not another package manager
- Not another tool
- Intelligently designed for an intuitive, elegant experience
- YAML-driven, Docker-composed, CLI-driven
- Dinosaurs are teh rad

### Just Like Everyone in Open Source:
Absolutely No Warranty...  But it's yours to operate and do what you want with.   DINOSAUR POPCICLES!
We believe in the power of absolute zero liability, because we are not hosting you and we are platform independent.

We don't even have a warranty for this stuff!  haha... Don't worry, you are STILL gonna sleep 100% better tonight.
Remember it's in YOUR CLOUD and not on whoever-the-heck's cloud.  Amazon is fair pants and so is Google, yay!

# WAIT WAIT THERE'S MORE!
![awesome-rex](http://forktheweb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/rext.gif)

### Free fo shizzle

- Some nerd has done all the work for you.  BRILLIANT!
- These stacks are pre-composed, unit-tested, and have all your normal tooling stuff.
- Our pTerodactyls are taking care of yo business, saving you the land before time and money!!
- Focus on building your apps, cause we took care of some crazy awesome strategy for you!
 
## Did we mention that this is 100% OPEN-SOURCE 

> That's right my brotha!  We slave-drive our wicked programmers so they can craft unbelievably cool components and frameworks designed to be smart, scalable, and effortless to deploy!  All on the MIT (Might Ingest Tyrannosaurs later) license!

#### Will code for food though, so if you got it don't hold back now! ;)

> (We also have a pterodactyl as a mascot!)

# Seriously
## This is not a joke

- We're talking about Dockistry, we don't actually slave-drive anyone haha
- That's right folks! Leave those GitKrakens alone from here on out
- Our flying jurassic beasts will provide complete security and keep your peace-of-mind, in mind!

## Comprehensive
- We build complete E2E strategies that work together and are designed *not to* fail miserably on any Windows 10, Linux Ubuntu Trusty, or Darwin/Mac OSX Environment that uses our fancy cross-platform SPA technology.
- We know those lousy [node-gyp issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/629) got you down!   

And it's time to fire that accountant, or nephew or whoever else was supposed to build your technology infrastructures months ago ...
 
- We know they still haven't finished the wordpress website, and jiminy xmas!
- Dockistry has a super-duper-fat HHVM mariadb stack running a souped-up PHP-LESS wordpress & calypso JSON-powered backend FFS!    
- Dinosaurs to the rescue! 
- Qucikly installed, tested, and deployed as a docker to your ec2/kube instance 
- Default SSL, behind a reverse proxy... Route 53 DNS done for you!

##### CAN YOUR NEPHEW AUTOMATE THAT LIKE OUR PTERODACTYL?  I THINK NOT!

### All Jokes Aside
We hope we have your interest, this projects is definitely a real-deal thing. ... and it's our labor of love.  Despite being pre-alpha, we're actually coming along at a faster rate than expected but are ALWAYS looking for help and contributors.

Hit us up on [gitter](https://gitter.im/forktheweb/dockistry) and say hi!

# Dockistry Fullstacks!
Every developer uses different tooling, dependencies and package management tools, scaffolds, and testing/monitoring tools.  There are too many tools out there, and we are not building another one.  Dockistry is a strategy engine, and it organizes all the crap you don't want to test and debug and learn how to setup, so that you can more easily "shop" strategies.

There are a million fullstack considerations, and we've broken them down into an easy to understand registry that is modular, and will have a full-fledged SPA app that runs on your desktop and stays in sync with our master repo!  Our experts are constantly forming stack strategies and assembling collections of the best products you can find on Github using kick ass pTerodactyl powered devops!

## introducing pTero!
***let pTerodactyls handle your business!***
- Have worked with Docker?  No matter if you haven't!  
- Have you ever worked with Rancher?  No matter if you haven't
- Have you ever setup EC2 stacks on Amazon AWS?  No matter
- BAM! All of our production stacks are docker-composed & rancher compatible!

![dinosaurs-rule](http://forktheweb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/dinosaurs.gif)
### dinosaurs rule!
- Stacks are CLI-driven, searchable, and one-click deployed!
- Deploy to your localmachine on a .dev domain
- Deploy to staging or production hosts at Amazon EC2
- Deploy Kubernetes nodes to Google Cloud Hosting!

### what do you get?
Just [take a gander] at all the cool virtualized apps we include in our CLI installer!
- that's like everything a tech company needs to get up and running in one shot!
- no kidding, we even give you a robot.  no for real, we do!  don't you want a frickin robot?!
- hate installing stuff?  no worries boss, deploy our crazy-cool amazon AMI image!
- wanna give Amazon more of your cash cause they super TIGHT-BALS!?  ... then deploy an **entire cluster** of amazon stuff via cloud-formation .... we build it right in!
- even more fancy then cloud-formation, our docker-composed stacks can perform their own health checks and auto-scale right on the EC2 instance.  
- That's like having an auto-scaling cluster RIGHT IN AN INSTANCE!  How cool is that, it saves you like mad cash!  

It's under the premise that most people want to compare stuff, but only the stuff that matters, that Dockistry has been created.  
It's been created by veteran web nerds who care about you, and our technology is backed by a benevolent winged-beast.... our god like overseer.

# Wow Such Example. So stack.
### More better than traditional stack.

> [pdf](https://goo.gl/dnBX4u)

The diagram below shows an example of a production fullstack solution on AWS built automatically using our CLI.  It contains everything a developer or company might need to operate on an EC2 Ubuntu Trusty HHVM image, with [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Rancher](https://rancher.com), and Dockistry portable registries.  This is one of many YAML driven stacks that are built by experts using the Dockistry CLI to address the needs of various strategies.
 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forktheweb/dockistry/master/Dockistry-Production-Deploy-Example-Stack.png" width="100%">

## a powerful strategy engine
Dockistry puts emphasis on strategy and tooling configs, because these days that is 99% of the problem in setting up environments. 
Tools like Ansible and Vagrant address the problem of setup, but do not address the clear need of strategy-shopping, and the ADHD mindset of most developers in that we are magpies who want the shiniest thing.  We want it now!

Managing compatibility issues and dependencies, and knowing which packages to install is also a problem that is only solved by a strategy-focused development community & master repository.  We do not wish to create another tool, but rather provide expertly developed strategies for various deploys that work on any host.  We encourage our master strategy registry to be cloned locally for forking & we also encourage contributions to the cause. 

# Why Dockistry?
> **There are currently too many projects focused on tooling being provided in communities like GitHub, and not enough focus on providing stable Continuous Delivery Strategies.**  

Dockistry focuses **only** on the big picture & elegance/ simplicity.  We make every effort to integrate as many existing (useful) tools as possible from the existing open source community while avoiding false affordance, and working to increase intuition with our product.   We operate containers as a service (CaaS) via a  **platform agnostic** tooling kit over such existing technologies only, and using one entry-point for SSH2 via a powerful CLI that works on any cloud provider as a compiled binary.

##### 100% comprehensive, Platform Agnostic, AGPL, community-driven.

Dockistry empowers developers to quickly implement expert strategies from a centralized repository that is curated.   Each strategy is created to serve a very specific purpose.   Our focus is on Reactive apps for Web and E2E, and on Continous Delivery & horizontal scaling capabilities.  We've incorporated many framework & stack options that we find useful in our repo (over 10 baselines and 300 forks, with thousands of possible combinations).

The repositories we host at [stackfork](https://labs.stackfork.com:2003) utilize a compose process that is 100% YAML driven. Any  tooling & build/deploy files are volume mounted in their filesystem using Aufs/Docker on the host, and execute NPM/Bower/Yeoman and other commands after the container is composed automatically.  We believe this to be the best scenario for backups and storage, and it's quite flexible.  We embrace usage of all the existing tools out there, and we wrote our CLI backend using existing tools intentionally. 

##### automatic tooling setup
Containers are fully disposable and volumes are backed-up without exporting each container state.  After containers are composed, our Dockistry CLI follows whatever rules are in the dockistry-compose.yml file by executing a variety of container attachments and package management tasks.  For instance it could attache a NodeJS container and run npm commands, or Yeoman scaffold setups.  These tasks are easily configured for both builds and deploys using either our web-based editor, or your notepad/terminal. 

Our CLI helps you create & distribute a fully comprehensive process for stack management & clustering.  Each stack is environment specific & serves a tailored strategy.  All stacks are easy to fork/customize since they are entirely YAML driven and very lightweight (housing mostly .yml/.json/.js/.ts files only).

# Examples
> **example #1:**  You might have a strategy for a single page application (SPA) that builds out your mobile app via Cordova/Phonegap variations and using an Amazon Code Pipeline with Gulp compiler process housed on Docker and served by HHVM with Citus or MongoDB.  That's complex and the stack is far different if it's to be production-ready.

> **example #2:** That would be far different from the tooling used on a performance tuned API stack written on the NodeJS API or using something like Goat/ Gorilla on a GVM powered stack running Go-lang 1.4.  If we are using this stack for testing or development, we might use something like Ansible or Vagrant to configure our stack with the right tools and this can be done inside the stack repository (strategy).  

For every development or production use case, there are considerations and almost certainly caveats, especially when executing a comprehensive E2E strategy with a code-pipeline and multiple collaborating developers.

> Each stack you compose using the Dockistry CLI will operate to serve the needs of a particular strategy for   development or production (or both).  All repos are prefixed with "dev, prod, or fork" to make that clear.  So if we are creating a stack that focuses on wordpress theme development, it will contain no performance tuning, but it will contain a ton of developer tools like vim-spf13, samson, c++ nodegyp, and it will be called something like "devstack-wp-cplus".

Simple installation for our tools:
* download CLI from our dockerhub image
* run ``` dockistry setup ```

That's pretty much it, then just run:
``` dockistry make /location/of/dockistry-compose.yml  ```

``` pTero devops ``` handes everything from there through Rancher, Docker-Compose, and using a variety of tooling set up commands like npm, bower, and anything else existing in the mount yml.  This allows for a full stack to be created along with load balancing, clustering, and everything else necessary to operate both development and production stacks using the repositories we host.  

The dockistry YAML rules provide a roadmap for the system to follow when installing repositories, which allows it to dynamically update the docker-compose container attachments & paths.  It then passes all of that info to the Rancher API and builds the cluster so it will appear in there all nicely!

Because we install a webterm and editor on your specified URL (over SSL proxy), you can use that as a management tool too.
It allows for browsing and composing our repos, and configuring the stacks using the dockistry, docker, and rancher compose yaml, along with other yaml directives for npm, bower, yeoman, and more.

# No Wheel Re-inventing
We use *only* existing tools for stack setup, such as NPM for depenencies, and/or systems such as Bower, scaffolds such as Yeoman, and Go-lang tools.  Docker stacks are composed to avoid custom Makefiles and custom Dockerfiles (ideally), this allows everything to be executed as a single process that is easy to review and organize in our YAML editor.  It's not *always* possible to do that (for certain compilation processes, for example), but we avoid Dockerfiles, Makefiles, and scripted shell commands whenever possible, and avoid JSON in favor of YAML whenever possible (we convert it on deploy for most configurations).

##### Strategy storage
We expect and encourage you to have your own strategies, and if they are working well for you, please contribute them to our StackFork master repo because the idea here is to implement strategy recommendations from developers all over the world.  Each developer has different goals and backgrounds, so we are certain to see a plethora of interesting use cases and tooling setups.  Our hope is to drive innovation in these areas, especially in the usage of of React/Aurelia SPA(s), datagrids, and componentry.

##### Master repo
One of our primary goals is to organize our "StackFork" master repository in such a way that it can be used as by anyone without making it complicated and confusing (and that's not easy).  This will allow developers to turn to Dockistry to allow them to switch strategy easily when new sets of tools come out without spending unnecessary time on configurations and tooling, and that includes use cases for tools like compass/phonegap or even Java operations like Gradle. 

The configuration and usage of tools like Atom or VIM can take *days*, so it is our goal to really remove that as a boundary because you know each time you download one of our stacks, it's been created by an expert in their respective field and curated through our peer review process.  We do not want our repository to operate like NPM (tons of dead and useless  projects).

##### E2E and Continuous Delivery focused
Using our registries as a playbook, and through using YAML, you can quickly create virtually any kind of relevant react application or API, go-lang app, or even an ethereum blockchain app.  

"Strategies" can include virtually anything that would need to live on an AWS or Google Cloud that horizontally scales:
* cloud instances/ environments
* servers/ backends
* middleware/ tasks
* uix/ componentry
* cli tools and editors

# Deploy clusters in a single step
Dockistry provides a simple, one-step, elegant method to deploy complex software in cloudbased clusters and for E2E implementations (apps) using one set of YAML and our web-based editor.  The only pre-requisite is a domain name that will be set up by our CLI (you will need to point the A record, or have the CLI do it via route53 automatically).

Dockistry is both an editor and a private provider for web-based git repos, docker registries, and npm registries.  When you install Dockistry for the first time, our CLI will provide installation options for deploying your own local copies of our master registries. 

These registries are in pre-alpha, but are <a href="https://labs.stackfork.com:2003/">available</a> here on request for those wishing to contribute.  

Our master contains many modular stacks that are packaged to deploy in development and production environments.  Your registry copies are ephemeral and you are encouraged to roll out updates by destroying them and downloading new copies with the CLI tools we provide.

The [Dockistry CLI](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/dockistry-cli.md) sets you up (optionally) with a full-on infrastructure using the AWS and Google SDK via pTero devops.
* gitlab ce installation and config over ssl on sub-domain
* rancher master/slave
* rocketchat and hubot instance
* nginx reverse proxy
* ssl fully automated 
* gnupg keyrings

Our open source web-based editor allows you to stack these repositories by automating the creation of cloud based servers on various providers, automating the Docker-Compose/ Rancher process & server configurations, installing your favorite dependency tools, and then rolling out your actual software for unit-testing.  We operate Gitlab CI for test automation on various OS.

**To put it as simply as possible:**

Dockistry is for building Reactive apps and the infrastructure necessary for any developer or company to do that quickly and easily on any cloud hosting provider.  


Dockistry currently supports these hosts:
* Amazon AWS
* Google Cloud
* Docker Machine/Swarm

We intend for this project to be fully platform agnostic upon launching the 1.0 version (Stable), but the beta versions are specific to AWS and Kubernetes environment setups. 

#### "It is not our intention to create (yet another) package manager."

### Primary use case
The developers of Dockistry have primarily used it for E2E websites and mobile apps using Javascript with React-style  frameworks and NodeJS.  We use tons of web components, CDNjs packages, SVG tools, and lots of other shiny web things.  It's because of the magpie-esque tooling considerations and overwhelming amount of customization options, that we identified this clear need for a strategic, focused, and comprehensive management system using existing tooling. 

> We intend to incorporate stacks in our repo that use the following types of React frameworks:

* React native
* Aurelia
* Angular
* VueJS
* Riot
* Roots

**When combining the above frameworks with baseline stacks, you can have hundreds of tooling considerations and variants:**

* package managers (npm/ bower/ yeoman scaffolds/ etc.)
* webpack & polymer components
* ui toolkits such as material-ui, angular-material, semantic ui, uikit
* there are nearly 40 different datagrid providers 
* editors are also available such as vim-spf13 and even SAWS (docker-composed)

> Dockistry code is stored on StackFork while we are in a pre-alpha stage, as we do not want people executing processes that may harm their servers or development environments.  

### Looking for contributors!
We are actively looking for developers to participate by contributing their own strategies (even portions of them that they are most familiar with).  Our devteam is super friendly, and we are available easily via Gitter.
 
# deploys

##### elegant forking & kitty-cat-simple stacking deploys
All stacks are 100% SSL-LE, Docker-composed, in modular-fork format.  You just pick the repositories you want, and use the YAML config they supply.  That means they can easily be joined together in various configs with various UI, datagrids, cdnJS, NPM, Bower, Yeoman, JSPM, Go-lang, RVM, and other dependency management tools. 

No limitations on language or platform but obviously we lean towards NodeJS and Go with Citus/Postgre or Mysql/Aurora.

# instances
Dockistry can build rock solid instances from the CLI automatically for Amazon AMI or Google Kubernetes hosts and using existing technology for HHVM/Paravirtual virtual servers that is very simple and elegant.  This allows you to install a full stack with tons of features without having to configure anything.

# infrastructure
We hope to make many people have an easier time setting up their programming tooling and infrastructure by using Dockistry Strategies including our tooling/ infrastructure options:

- Setup Rancher as a master instance using our AMI/Kube/Droplet
- Pre-configured deployment of Gitlab CE, Rancher, Discourse, Rocketchat-Hubot, Private Registries (Dockers/ NPMs), Wekan board and others
- Optionally pre-load test frameworks for React, Aurelia, Wordpress, Angular, and Feathers and build/deploy them on your test environments
- Our Go CLI can build test stacks for a variety of strategies in a single process
- The build process is entirely customizable via the dockistry-yml file, and the other configs in the repository.
- You can easily fork a repository to make minor modifications for your deployment

# specifications

- [frameworks](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docks-frameworks.md) - supported reactive frameworks
- [componentry](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docks-componentry.md) - tools we're considering supporting or ones we already are (WIP)
- [coding standards](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docks-code.md) - our development philosophies
- [pTero devops](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docks-ptero.md) - an example stack, but pTero is also a Go-lang shell program that does all our automation for AWS, GC, etc.
- [about](https://github.com/forktheweb/dockistry/blob/master/docks-ptero.md) - a little info about the developers

# stack info
- docker-composed, rancher managed, single-step builds
- all dockistry strategies are contained in forkable repositories.  
- we encourage forking and modification where necessary.
- there are many stack repos we house, but here are some examples:
    * SSL Citus [Postgre] with Go Json Api paired with React App (clustered and rancher manged)
    * SSL Rancher on Ubuntu/ROS set up with NginxProxy/LetsEncrypt (built to manage other hosts)
    * Wordpress with Zero PHP (i.e.- Calypso backend, Aurelia Front-end, Composer for deps, in a docker container group)
 - near-zero setup for most repos (some will require a top-level domain to be registered or added manually)
 - unit-tested (not all repos require unit testing, such as performance-tuned prod envs)

# scaling 
We love the ability to scale, and that's why we prefer to use postgre with citus, or mongo/rethink when creating projects that need scaling built right in.  

Rancher compositional YAML configures automatic container-scaling based on the settings of the health check and memory.  If you need the instances to scale based on alarms/monitoring that is a bit more complex, but can be done using the auto-scaling features of Cloudwatch for instance (with AWS).  Typically you won't run into this problem given enough swap space unless you are expecting to hit the front page of reddit, but it's nice to think about in advance of the scenario actually happening.

Another great option is to run the database instance on an entirely separate worker node, and run all containers externally.  Or you could use something like Mysql on Aurora if you are really wanting to pay a lot of money & get very improved speed.

#### currently we support
- amazon aws [instantly cloud-formation deploy & hot-sync of data from our S3 multi-az
- google cloud [instantly deployed from gluster or s3 using convoy or duplicity]

#### soon we will provide drop-ins for
- digital ocean
- bare metal
- heroku 
- scalingo
- devo.ps

#### gitlab updates
we exclude updates from forked repos intentionally because our stacks are unit-tested and stable.  we use bleeding-edge branches to test updates on forks prior to putting them in dockistry as masters.

> important note: _this project is pre-alpha, though many modules are production tested and ready for immediate use_ 

- we are opensource 100%
- private repos for community development, so just ask to get access.
- they are private cause we think it's bad if devs are downloading our broken stuff accidentally on github
- our first published release will incorporate one master dockistry with over 60 sub-repos that will be made production/public status

# technical overview
- comprehensive fullstack solution for deployment to dev/stage/prod envs.
- peer-reviewed security practices with fullstack capabilities above and beyond those of traditional dockerhub devops images
- a modular git-driven architecture containing skeletons & deployments for many different combinations of dockerhub driven app images
- complete 12-factor support that aims to be cloud-agnostic, platform-agnostic, and licensed under an AGPL
- immediate deployment and configuration of many NodeJS driven frameworks for developers building SPA apps (i.e.- Aurelia, React, Vue)
- containers designed for deployment virtually and which are fully docker-compose 2.0 ready with side-kick support into rancher-compose
- utility containers for backup automation on any mounted image via duplicity
- powerful backup & cache systems with incrementally recognizant architecture via bup and kup
- wordpress deployment using dependency management via composer, proactive environment setup using ansible

# ssl is automated on every environment
- we embrace [port-80 shaming](https://github.com/jimmycuadra/port-80-shame) because it's fun.
- yes, we fully automate SSL deploys for you with Zero Setup using the Let's Encrypt CA (no SSL errors)
- we are on the way to implementing Gnupg keyrings and validated GPG signatures too.
- we also embrace calling out comcast for injecting javascript, an illegal practice (as seen with the recent Verizon suit)

#### security
We intend to use Ephemeral & destructive Gnupg keyrings with external etcd/ consul & watchtower support.  For security reasons, our stacks are moderately opinionated as far as the types of SSL and encryption we use and recommend, but this still leaves developers in control because we are adoptive of docker-compose, Rancher, Ubuntu, and in favor of YAML ubiquity.  We are in favor of default-secure practices and SSL by default for all environments.
