- currently 20 gigs of repository images are available & our ECR uses Janitor and is well-maintained in a private GitLabCE
- __if you are a developer or team who is interested in participating:__
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/disruptiveware/dockistry.svg)](https://gitter.im/disruptiveware/dockistry?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) is the best way to reach us, as it filters directly into our internal Rocket webRTC and Xampp set-ups.
- mention "@ptero help" if the bot is available.  the winged-beast install your oauth credentials from github and even deploy certain apps automatically based on a simple questions & a basic sms validation (no-github).

# pre-alpha gitlab
- provides a collection of packages in the form of forkable repositories designed to be docker-composed and interchanged
# participate
- If you wish to participate in the development effort, visit [gitter]().  both are very new to the community so we appreciate any smoke or sage you might have to offer.
- 
- comprehensive fullstack solution for deployment to dev/stage/prod envs.
- peer-reviewed security practices with fullstack capabilities above and beyond those of traditional dockerhub devops images
- a modular git-driven architecture containing skeletons & deployments for many different combinations of dockerhub driven app images
- complete 12-factor support that aims to be cloud-agnostic, platform-agnostic, and licensed under an AGPL
- immediate deployment and configuration of many NodeJS driven frameworks for developers building SPA apps (i.e.- Aurelia, React, Vue)
- containers designed for deployment virtually and which are fully docker-compose 2.0 ready with side-kick support into rancher-compose
- utility containers for backup automation on any mounted image via duplicity
- powerful backup & cache systems with incrementally recognizant architecture via bup and kup
- wordpress deployment using dependency management via composer, proactive environment setup using ansible

# ssl is automated on every environment
- we embrace port 80 shaming.  "america... fuck yeah!".  [contact us]() here if you need us to brighten someone's day.
- yes, we do this for developer environments automatically too
- immediately deploy our unit-tested, validated configurations via a private ECR
- we also offer a private registry for nodejs packages called sinopia

- we also embrace calling out comcast for injecting javascript, an illegal practice (as seen with the recent Verizon suit)
